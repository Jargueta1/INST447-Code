# INST447-Code
 This repo. stores the code for our INST 447 group project

## Team proposal 
Domain for our project is weather in Washington D.C.
The data will at least include the following: 
    Temperature
    Precipitation
    Wind Patterns 
        Wind speed
        Wind Direction 
    Huminity
    UV index
    Heat index 
The objective is to determine patterns in the data to create weather advisory communications 
We would focus on rainy days and what the weather seems to be around those days.
